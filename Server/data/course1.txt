Concepts
• Information: anything that can be represented using bits 
• Resource: generic term that can signify data, equipment et. al.
• Package: a way of storing data
• Link: a connection among network members
• Node: a computer from the network which has an address
• Protocol: rules used to communicate
• Communication: information exchanges between network nodes

A protocol defines the format and the order of messages 
exchanged betweentwo or more communicating entities, 
as well as the actions taken on the transmissionand/or 
receipt of a message or other event.

Definitions:
– Interconnected collection of autonomous computers
– A network may be defined recursively as two or more 
nodes physically connected, as well as two or several 
networks connected through one or more nodes.
• Aspects:
– Hardware: connect computers from a physical point of view
– Software: Protocols – specify services provided by the network

Necessity:
• Resource sharing (physical, data)
• Reliability
• Reduced costs
• Impact in real life:
– Remote information access
– Interactive entertainment
– E-Commerce

Networks types- classification

• After the spatial arrangement:
    – PAN (Personal Area Network)
    – LAN (Local Area Network) 
    – MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
    – WAN (Wide Area Network)
    – Internet

• Depending on transmission technology:
– Broadcast networks (one channel to 
communicate)
    • broadcast, multicast
– Point-to-point networks
    • unicast

Network topologies

Physical topology: the way computers are connected in 
the network
Logical topology: the way in which data are transferd from 
one computer to other
Possible physical topologies for:
– Broadcast networks - LAN
    • Bus
    • Ring
– Point-to-point networks
    • Star
    • Ring
    • Tree
    • Mesh

Networks types- classification

• Depending on the hardware technology (and 
software) used for interconnection:
–Networks using wired transmission medium
–Networks using wireless transmission medium

• Depending on the components:

– Homogeneous: the computer networks use 
similar configurations and protocols
• Example: A network using Microsoft Windows via TCP/IP
– Heterogeneous: the network contains different 
types of computers, operating systems and/or 
different protocols
• Example: a LAN that connects a smart phone with an 
Android and an Apple Machintosh computer

Components

• Host - it’s a computational system connected to the Internet
• Hub Network - a device (often a signal 
booster) used to connect multiple 
devices => network segment
• Switch - a device which filters network 
packets and resends them
• Router - device providing connectivity between networks, perform routing 
packets between these networks
• Bridge - device that connects two LANs or two segments of the same LAN
• Gateway - is a connection point of two networks that use different base 
protocols
• Repeater - device that receives signals that it rebroadcast at a higher level 
or higher power, so that the signal can cover large areas without degrading its quality
