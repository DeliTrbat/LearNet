# LearNet

Main tasks of the app:
Build a client / server architecture system to help you learn the basics of Computer Networking. All information will be managed on the server. The client, having an attractive graphical interface will allow you to: search for information, discuss with other users on a particular topic, save and classify these discussions. Some users will be able to be grouped in a friends list.

To compile the server, you must have the "sqlite3" library installed, which you can download with: sudo apt install sqlite3 ( on Ubuntu terminal) or from SQLite download page "https://www.sqlite.org/download.html". Server execution is done using the "server" executable.
To compile the client you will need do install Qt creator 5 that can be installed with: sudo apt-get install qt5-default ( on Ubuntu terminal).
The server port is 2000 and the client is automatically set to connect to the 127.0.0.1 ip address.
